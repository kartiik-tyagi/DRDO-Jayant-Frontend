# Jayant frontend handbook

Human reference for people working **without the internet**. The running code is the authority. If a page here disagrees with a file under `src/`, trust the file and correct this handbook later.

This book has three jobs:

1. Let you run, read, change, and extend **this** application.
2. Teach enough **React** that you can do that work, and ordinary React work, from these pages alone.
3. Teach **Material UI 9** and styling the same way, one component at a time, for the libraries installed in this folder.

You do not need a backend. Sign-in, the map tools, planning, the exercise, and administration all talk to a dummy API inside `src/shared/api/`. A future real server replaces that folder. The screens stay.

## What this application is

Jayant is a GIS picture for an exercise. People sign in by **appointment** (APEX, CoSC, a theatre commander), not by a personal name. The map is the product. Filters, resources, plans, themes, and the menu come from the server stand-in. Layout geometry is fixed in each branch’s `src/shell/Shell.jsx`.

There is no ORBAT screen. Do not add one unless someone asks for a new product.

## What is deliberately not in the product

These exist in the older GIS Foundation application and are **not** built here. Do not document them as if they were, and do not start them unless asked:

- GeoJSON import
- A 3D Cesium globe
- An audit-log screen
- A real authentication server
- Server-enforced role permissions
- An in-app config editor for JSON files
- A live STOMP / Kafka / ActiveMQ client (the stream panel is a dummy walker inside the API)

`public/config/*.json` is leftover. No file under `src/` reads it. Editing those JSON files changes nothing on screen.

## How to keep this book true

After you change behaviour, update the chapter that describes it. A recipe that names a file which does not exist is wrong. Delete or rewrite that step.
